# About this project
This is my second project and the main purpose was to get more familiar with React. 

### Problems in this journey...
The database used for requesting media items is not consistent when it comes to the information delivered. 
Due to this, a lot of checking and verifying has to be done and is an ongoing project.

Example:
* Exactly same media object can be returned twice in same request or in different page number but still same "section"
* Incomplete object properties.
* Inconsistent object properties. Sometimes it is null, undefined, "", etc. 

### Questions in my mind

Is my way of splitting and reusing components right or wrong? This is definitely something I want to improve and learn.
My aim is to learn what best practice is considered and apply that. Although I've had hard time finding what best practice is in different projects and scenarios ;) 

### To use Hooks or not...
Most components started as React Hooks components but the handling of state, dependencies and complexity made me refactor most Hooks components to Class components. React Hooks is something that I will dive in to straight after this.

### Other
Comments will be added in the next couple of days.
Next "big" task is to learn and use animations in React. I made the choice to not add Bootstrap from React-Bootstrap and instead just used Bootstrap CSS - don't know what is considered good or bad, I didn't want to add lots of components AND CSS.

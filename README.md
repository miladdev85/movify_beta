# About this project
A website where you can find what to watch next. Purpose was to get more familiar with React, Router and Bootstrap. 

### Problems in this journey...
The database used for requesting media items is not consistent when it comes to the information delivered. 
Due to this, a lot of checking and verifying has to be done and is an ongoing project.

Example:
* Exactly same media object can be returned twice in same request or in different page number but still same "section"
* Incomplete object properties.
* Inconsistent object properties. Sometimes it is null, undefined, "", etc. 

### To use Hooks or not...
Most components started as React Hooks components but the handling of state, dependencies and complexity made me refactor most Hooks components to Class components. React Hooks is something that I will dive in to straight after this.

### Other
Next "big" task is to learn and use animations in React.
